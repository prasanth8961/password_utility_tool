   - Analyzes the strength of a password based on:
     - Length
     - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
     - Inclusion of digits

   - Uses a mix of:
     - Uppercase letters
     - Lowercase letters
     - Numbers
     - Special characters

3. **Brute-Force Time Estimator**
   - Calculates the estimated time to brute-force a password based on its complexity.
   - Assumes a brute-force rate of 1 billion attempts per second.
